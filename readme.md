#WizardDuelGame

##Description

This simple website demonstrates a basic RPG combat system inspired by roleplaying games from the 1990s.

To control the game, simply click the buttons provided.

The Attack button deals a random amount of damage.
The Heal button heals a random amount of health.
The Defend button reduces the amount of damage a player will take should the other player attack.
Finally, the Reset button resets the health of both players.

This is a basic implementation made over 2 weeks. As such, it is rough around the edges.
As I learn more and gain more experience, this project will likely receive further updates.

I hope that what you see here is, at the moment, satisfactory.
Enjoy!

##Issues

This project has the following issues, to be fixed at a later date:
- When completing the battle, the Reset button does not return control to the user.
- The Heal operation may, on occasion, heal the user above the maximum.
- The array of buttons may not work properly when resizing the window.
